\caption{Variance of the SDF}
 \caption*{We report the average conditional variance of the SDF and its standard deviation constructed under various sets of assumptions. “Factor timing” is our full estimate, which takes into account variation in the means of the PCs and the market. “Factor investing” imposes the assumption of no factor timing: conditional means are replaced by their unconditional counterpart. “Market timing” only allows for variation in the mean of the market return}
