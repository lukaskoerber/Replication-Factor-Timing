\caption{Various data choices}
 \caption*{The table reports summary statistics of predictive regressions in Table 2 for various data construction choices. Specifically, we report the OOS total R2 and the number of PC portfolios for which the OOS R2 is statistically significant using the placebo test of Kelly and Pruitt (2013). The first column reports the number of portfolios used for the underlying characteristic sorts. The second column reports the holding period in months. For holding periods longer than one month, the third column reports whether principal components are estimated using monthly or holding period returns. The fourth column reports whether the anomaly returns are orthogonalized relative to the aggregate market. The fifth column reports whether the anomaly returns and book-to-market values are normalized to have equal variance.}
